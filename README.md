# DiscordBot
 A Discord Bot which will encourage you by sending quotes

# Description 
This Discord bot is made using **Python** and host it for free in the cloud using *Repl.it*. Along the way I used Repl.it's built-in database and created a Discord bot that uses **Webhooks** to connect with *GitHub* which will basically notify me about anything of this repository. Moreover, I used *UptimeRobot* to give it continuous connection even after I close the file/tab.

**Note**: I saved my discord bot token in another *.env* file. You can put it here instead of *TOKEN*

*DM* me for any queries
