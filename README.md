# DiscordBot
 A Discord Bot which will encourage you by sending quotes

# Description 
This Discord bot is made using **Python** and host it for free in the cloud using *Repl.it*. Along the way I used Repl.it's built-in database and created a Discord bot that uses **Webhooks** to connect with *GitHub* which will basically notify me about anything of this repository. Moreover, I used *UptimeRobot* to give it continuous connection even after I closed the file/tab.

*Note*: You don't need to pay anything to host the Bot

# About Discord Bot
We need 
<ul>
 <li><b>Discord Api</li> 
 <li><b>Python Library</li>  
 <li>cloud computing platfrom called <b>Repl.it</li>
 </ul>

For **Continous Connection** purpose I used *keep_alive.py* 
 
**Note**: As *Repl.it* is public free hosting site, therefore anyone can access to my *main.py*. That is why I saved my discord bot token in another *.env* file. You can put it in *client.run* method instead of writing *TOKEN*.

*DM* me for any queries
